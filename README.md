# Intro

When starting out with [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), I did not find an easy accessible resource to be able to play with the REST API.
Therefore I created it myself. Here you will find a [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection to do just that.

Take a look below as to see what is in this collection.

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or remarks.

  - Tag image

  This collection is subject to change.
